  This application note demonstrates how to extend the Tracker One with additional functionality for tank level monitoring:

  - Adding GPIO ports using an MCP23008 (3.3V compatible)
  - Adding ADC channels using an ADS1015 for 12-bit resolution
  - Connecting a tank level sensor with 240-33 ohm resistance
  - Integrating a 12V boost converter for low-power 12V sensors, necessary for the tank level sensor
